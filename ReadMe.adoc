# 🌬️ Smart Air Quality Monitoring and Ventilation Control System with ESP32 & Arduino Cloud

This project uses an **ESP32 DevKit** and an **MQ135 air quality sensor** to monitor and predict air quality. It intelligently controls a ventilation system via a relay based on both **real-time and predicted PPM levels**. The system also syncs with **Arduino IoT Cloud** for remote monitoring and data logging.

## 📡 Features

- 📊 Real-time air quality monitoring with MQ135.
- 🧠 Basic machine learning (linear regression) for PPM prediction.
- 🌀 Ventilation control (low, medium, high) via relay.
- ☁️ Arduino IoT Cloud integration for remote dashboard access.
- 🕒 Anti-flicker logic to avoid frequent relay switching.

## 🔧 Hardware Used

- ESP32 DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1
- MQ135 Gas Sensor
- DHT11
- RGB LED Module
- Relay Module (5V or 3.3V compatible)
- Jumper Wires
- Optional: Fan or motor for demo ventilation

## ☁️ Arduino Cloud Integration

This project is linked to **Arduino IoT Cloud** for real-time monitoring. You can:

- View current PPM values
- See predicted air quality trends
- Check ventilation status (ON/OFF, speed)
- Remotely manage or expand the system

### Cloud Variables Used

- `airQualityPPM` (float)
- `predictedPPM` (float)
- `ventilationStatus` (String)
- `ventilationSpeed` (String)
- `temperature` (integer)
- `humidity` (integer)


## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Measure**: MQ135 provides analog gas sensor data.
2. **Calculate**: Analog value is converted to estimated PPM.
3. **Store**: Readings are added to a sliding window for regression.
4. **Predict**: Linear regression is applied to predict future PPM.
5. **Control**: Based on current and predicted values:
   - Ventilation is activated/deactivated via relay.
   - Speed is set: low, medium, or high.
6. **Sync**: Data is published to Arduino IoT Cloud.
